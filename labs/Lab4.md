### Why is it important to choose a license?
Having a license on an open source project gives you some amount of control over how the project is redistributed. Also, a licensed project is far more likely to attract collaborators and users, because the rules governing its use and distribution are established. It forms a fundamental basis of the agreement between the creator, the collaborators, and the users.
### Why shouldn't you use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
It is unclear what the user is able to do with the project. A vendor that doesn't have an explicit license on an open source project either doesn't know how to manange their project or intends on restricting it, so they are probably unreliable. There's no guarantee that a project actually meets the requirements of open source if it doesn't have a license.
### Why the Web beat Gopher
The Web's open systems model definitely gave it a huge edge over Gopher. The collective efforts of a broad open source community was much more effective at making decisions than Gopher's relatively small team was. Also, the Web attracted a much larger base of developers due to the lack of a licensing fee. Gopher was also forked far too early, which lead to the Web gaining a huge momentum lead.
### Linux's choice of GPL v2 license
It makes sense for Linux to use the GPL v2 license, as it is very permissive. It allows users to redistribute the software as long as the orginal code and any modifications are made available. The majority of [Linux's development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux) was done by an expanding open source community; it makes sense that the project would remain open to public modification. Linus Torvalds has [stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux#Copyright,_trademark,_and_naming) that he doesn't intend on updating to the GPL v3 license, as it adds unwanted restrictions.

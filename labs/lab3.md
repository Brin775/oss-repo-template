### Github analysis vs. gitstats
There are a lot of clear differences in the stats being displayed. For instance, github lists only 2 contributors where gitstats lists 4. Also, gitstats lists a far lower number of total lines of code of 1,522, while the command git ls-files -z | xargs -0 wc -l reported 11,352 lines. It seems like gitstats provides a much more accurate and in-depth analysis of a repo then what is immediately visible on github.
